AI-Powered User Profiling & Recommendation System using Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro Integration)
Developed and deployed an advanced user profiling and recommendation engine by integrating Amazon's Nova Pro AI model via the Amazon Bedrock SDK. The system analyzes user profile images to extract rich contextual attributes such as facial features, skin tone, hair and eye color, accessories, background elements, and inferred lifestyle and interests. These insights are used to personalize the user experience—displaying tailored information on the homepage—and to significantly enhance ad recommendations and search results.

Incorporated price analytics and behavioral data into the recommendation logic, resulting in measurable business impact:

Improved ad recommendation performance, contributing to a ₹1 Cr+ increase in profitability
Enhanced search relevance and conversion, leading to an estimated ₹2 Cr+ uplift in revenue
Achieved a 5% increase in user retention through personalized user engagement
This project showcases the successful application of generative AI, computer vision, and data-driven personalization to drive revenue and user satisfaction at scale.
