AI-Powered User Profiling with Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro Integration)
Integrated Amazon's Nova Pro AI model via Amazon Bedrock SDK to build an intelligent user profiling system. The solution analyzes usersâ€™ profile 
images to extract detailed attributes such as facial features, skin tone, hair and eye color, accessories, visible background elements, and inferred 
lifestyle/interests. Leveraged this rich contextual data to personalize the user experience by dynamically displaying user attributes on the homepage 
and enhancing ad targeting and search recommendations based on inferred profile insights. The project demonstrates deep integration of generative AI 
with practical applications in personalization and recommendation systems.
